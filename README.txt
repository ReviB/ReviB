ReviB
=====

This app has been created as a learning tool in order to teach people what to do 
in case of finding an unconscious person and how to perform cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation manouevres during a cardiac arrest.

It comes with graphic instructions and voice commands in different languages addapted
to the casualty age (adult, child or baby) and incorporates a chronometer that counts
up the time since we start CPR. Besides, with its "training mode", you can also have 
the opportunity of self-learning and practice at any time.

Thanks for its easy use, "ReviB" will show you all the steps until medical help arrives.
