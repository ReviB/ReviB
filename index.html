        <h1>ReviB</h1>

<p>This app has been created as a learning tool in order to teach people what to do in case of finding an unconscious person and how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation manouevres during a cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>It comes with graphic instructions and voice commands in different languages addapted to the casualty age (adult, child or baby) and incorporates a chronometer that counts up the time since we start CPR. Besides, with its "training mode", you can also have the opportunity of self-learning and practice at any time.</p>

<p>Thanks for its easy use, "ReviB" will show you all the steps until medical help arrives.</p>

<h2>Installing the App</h2>

<p>Aplication will be available as soon as it is finished on:</p>
